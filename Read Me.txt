The StuckAtHome repository contains all of the code necessary to recreate the three modeling scenarios discussed in the Stuck at Home publication (DOI: insert here in the future). The individual model is the simplest random forest (RF) model in which a singular watershed is used to train and test RF models. The traveling model is when a RF model is trained in one watershed and tested in another. Finally, the all-but-one model is when a RF model is trained using the data from all watersheds except the watershed in which youâ€™re testing. 

Currently, code for the plots is not included in the repository. This would include the heatmaps, variable importance plots, partial plots, and time series plots. I may include this later if requested, but recreating those should be straightforward compared to recreating the models.
